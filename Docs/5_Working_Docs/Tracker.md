## This is a working document to track progress and ownership:

New python fetch! So I think bill_fetch_core.py works now. Schema changes to make it happen. Made timestamp comparisons offset-naive...that might bite me later. Now, running bill_detail_processor.py I think we've got the other issues sorted with fetch_core and detail_processor. validation is working, and seemingly so is batch_processor.

The bills details page `frontend/src/pages/BillDetails.js` is using the wrong Tags from the api I think. We also have a huge miss on the bills details page with not showing any of the "subjects" that we're now FINALLY pulling and populating correctly. You can see these subjects populating nicely on member C001088 (http://localhost:3000/representatives/C001088) under Cosponsored Bills.

Let's work on the next use case, "Introduction to Passage Time"

You cannot "curl" the endpoints, you can view the pages here `http://localhost:3001/analytics/legislative/passage-time`

Please, feel free to review other files as needed. The database is running(be sure you're not currently in an active venv), the backend api is running(under `backend/venv/bin/activate`), and the frontend is running and accessible at http://localhost:3001 - when validating SQL queries us psql, like the following-

```bash
deactivate && psql postgresql://localhost/project_tacitus_test -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bills;"
```

Acknowledge you understand what we're working on, and ask any questions you might have.

This might require some schema extensions, not sure, but eventually there will be a "Committee Details" page, that outlines the committees purpose, members, current bills, previous bills and voting history, and any other data/documents that the committee might publish.
