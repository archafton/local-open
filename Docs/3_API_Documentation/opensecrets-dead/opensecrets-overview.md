We are in the process of shutting down our API as we transition to a new tool later this year, but we do have bulk data available for academic purposes â€“ please use your academic email to sign-up so that we can verify your credentials.

If it is not an academic request, please email requests@opensecrets.org to inquire about buying custom datasets.
