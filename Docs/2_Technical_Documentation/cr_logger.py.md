#### Issues:
1. The logging setup is well-implemented, but consider using a rolling file handler to manage log file sizes and counts.
2. Error logging is well-structured, capturing error types and details; the use of `exc_info` is a good practice.
3. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of logging methods for different purposes.
4. The docstrings are clear; consider expanding them to include information about potential exceptions.
5. The default log directory is set to a relative path; ensure this path is appropriate for all environments.
6. Type hinting is well-implemented, providing clarity on expected input types for methods.
