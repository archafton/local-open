#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider making the log file configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages in the context of the failure.
3. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of methods for different XML operations.
4. Ensure that the expected XML structure is consistent with the actual data being processed.
5. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; the code appears to handle async execution correctly.
6. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
