#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider making the log file configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages in the context of the failure.
3. Interactions with the database are well-handled; ensure all database operations are properly wrapped in try-except blocks.
4. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of methods for different functionalities.
5. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; ensure the calling context supports async execution.
6. Type hinting is well-implemented, providing clarity on expected input and output types for methods.
7. The methods for fetching members and updating the database are well-implemented; ensure all data structures are consistent with expected input.
8. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
