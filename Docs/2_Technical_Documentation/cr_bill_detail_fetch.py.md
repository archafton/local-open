#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but the log file is hardcoded. Consider making it configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by ensuring the cursor is closed in the `finally` block.
3. The `update_database` function could benefit from additional error handling when fetching summary data.
4. Database connection may not close properly if an error occurs before connection is made.
5. Consider breaking down the `main` function into smaller functions for better readability.
6. Ensure that the data structure for bill details is consistent with expected input.
