#### Issues:
1. Error handling in `update_database` could be improved by ensuring the cursor is closed in the `finally` block.
2. Ensure environment variables for sensitive information are properly set.
3. Logging is good but could include more specific information during database updates.
4. The `save_to_json` function lacks error handling for file writing.
5. Database connection may not close properly if an error occurs before connection is made.
6. Consider breaking down the `main` function into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability.
