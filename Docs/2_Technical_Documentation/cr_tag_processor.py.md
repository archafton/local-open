#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider making the log file configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by ensuring the logger captures more specific information about the context of the error.
3. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; ensure the calling context supports async execution.
4. The code is well-structured, and the use of private methods for internal logic is a good design choice.
5. The `_normalize_tag` method is well-implemented; consider adding more normalization rules if necessary.
6. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
