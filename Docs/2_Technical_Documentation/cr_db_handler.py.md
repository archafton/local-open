#### Issues:
1. The connection string is retrieved from an environment variable; consider logging the success or failure of the connection test.
2. Error handling is generally robust; consider using logging to capture errors instead of just raising exceptions.
3. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of methods for different database operations.
4. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; ensure the calling context supports async execution.
5. Type hinting is well-implemented, providing clarity on expected input and output types for methods.
6. The SQL queries are straightforward; consider using parameterized queries consistently to prevent SQL injection.
7. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
