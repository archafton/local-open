#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider making the log file configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages in the context of the failure.
3. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of methods for different API interactions.
4. Ensure that all necessary environment variables are documented for users.
5. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; the code appears to handle async execution correctly.
6. The methods for extracting links and saving responses are well-implemented; ensure all data structures are consistent with expected input.
7. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
