#### Issues:
1. The Flask application is set up correctly; consider adding more routes and functionality.
2. The use of `load_dotenv()` is good practice; ensure sensitive information is managed appropriately.
3. There is no error handling implemented in the current route; consider adding error handling to manage potential issues.
4. The code is simple and straightforward; consider expanding it for more utility.
5. The code does not currently use type hinting; adding type hints for function parameters and return types would improve clarity.
6. The code lacks docstrings for functions; adding docstrings would provide clarity on the purpose and functionality of each function.
7. The application is set to run in debug mode; ensure this is disabled in production environments.
