# Tag System Implementation Status

## Phase 1 Progress

### Completed Components

1. Database Schema
   - Created `tag_types` table for categorizing tags (e.g., Policy Area, Bill Type)
   - Created `tags` table for storing individual tags with references to their types
   - Created `bill_tags` junction table for associating bills with tags
   - Added appropriate indexes and constraints

2. Frontend Components
   - Implemented `TagFilter` component with:
     * Operator selection (is, is_not, is_one_of, is_not_one_of)
     * Tag dropdown showing "Tag (Tag Type)"
     * Selected tags display with remove functionality
     * Enhanced dropdown with checkboxes and "Done" button
     * Single selection for "is" and "is_not" operators
     * Multi-select for "is_one_of" and "is_not_one_of" operators
     * Click-outside handling for selection confirmation
   - Integrated with `BillsFilters.js`
   - Added URL state persistence for tag filters

3. Backend API
   - Added `/api/tags` endpoint to fetch available tags
   - Enhanced `/api/bills` endpoint with tag filtering support
   - Implemented SQL queries for different tag operators (is, is_not, is_one_of, is_not_one_of)
   - Added server-side sorting with proper handling of null values
   - Optimized sorting to work across entire dataset, not just current page

4. Bills Table Improvements
   - Moved sorting logic to server-side for better performance
   - Fixed SPONSOR column sorting to properly handle null/N/A values
   - Implemented sorting across entire dataset instead of just current page
   - Added proper state management for sort configuration
   - Integrated with URL parameters for sort persistence
   - Fixed real-time sorting updates by properly handling sort state changes
