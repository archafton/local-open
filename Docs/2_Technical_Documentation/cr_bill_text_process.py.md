#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider making the log file configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages in the context of the failure.
3. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; the code appears to handle async execution correctly.
4. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns.
5. Ensure that all database operations are properly wrapped in try-except blocks to catch potential errors.
6. The tag processing logic is well-implemented; consider adding more validation rules if necessary.
7. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
