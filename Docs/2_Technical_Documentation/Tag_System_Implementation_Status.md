# Tag System Implementation Status

We need to make the "Select a tag..." drop down multi-select while up. Checkboxes can be clicked on and off for each value, and the page only refreshes / accepts the selections when the dropdown is closed, either by clicking a "Done" button on the dropdown modal itself, the user "tabs" to a new filter, or de-selects/clicks on the main page outside of the drop-down modal.

Extraneous: The sorting for all columns on the Bills Table sorts the presently-displayed results. But, that doesn't make sense. We're using pagination, 100 results per page. If I want to sort the names under the SPONSOR column reverse-alphabetically, instead of Z names being up top, it's C names, because it's only sorting what's on the current page, but we need to sort the entire set of results. Also, something is currently wrong with the SPONSOR sorting, it works once then gets stuck. Might just be in cases where there is no sponsor in the data so we get an "N/A" displayed. Not sure.

## Phase 1 Progress

### Completed Components

1. Database Schema
   - Created `tag_types` table for categorizing tags (e.g., Policy Area, Bill Type)
   - Created `tags` table for storing individual tags with references to their types
   - Created `bill_tags` junction table for associating bills with tags
   - Added appropriate indexes and constraints

2. Frontend Components
   - Implemented `TagFilter` component with:
     * Operator selection (is, is_not, is_one_of, is_not_one_of)
     * Tag dropdown showing "Tag (Tag Type)"
     * Selected tags display with remove functionality
   - Integrated with `BillsFilters.js`
   - Added URL state persistence for tag filters

3. Backend API
   - Added `/api/tags` endpoint to fetch available tags
   - Enhanced `/api/bills` endpoint with tag filtering support
   - Implemented SQL queries for different tag operators (is, is_not, is_one_of, is_not_one_of)
