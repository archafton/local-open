#### Issues:
1. The API key is retrieved from an environment variable; ensure this variable is documented for users.
2. Error handling is generally robust; consider logging errors for better traceability.
3. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of methods for different functionalities.
4. The use of asynchronous methods is appropriate; the code appears to handle async execution correctly.
5. Type hinting is well-implemented, providing clarity on expected input and output types for methods.
6. The `validate_response` method is a good addition to ensure the API response contains the expected fields.
7. The docstrings could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
