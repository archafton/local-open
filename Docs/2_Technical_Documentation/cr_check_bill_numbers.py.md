#### Issues:
1. Error handling is basic; consider using logging for consistency and detailed error information.
2. Database connection may not close properly if an error occurs before connection is made.
3. The function prints bill numbers directly; consider returning the list for more flexible use.
4. Add a main guard to allow for easier testing and reusability.
5. Ensure that the environment variable for the database URL is properly set.
