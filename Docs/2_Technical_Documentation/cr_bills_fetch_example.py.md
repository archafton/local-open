#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but consider adjusting the logging level in production to avoid excessive debug information.
2. Error handling could be improved by ensuring the cursor is closed in the `finally` block.
3. The `get_env_variable` function is well-implemented; ensure all necessary environment variables are documented.
4. Database connection may not close properly if an error occurs before connection is made.
5. The `lambda_handler` function could benefit from more specific error messages for different failure points.
6. Consider breaking down the `lambda_handler` function into smaller functions for better readability.
