# Minimum Viable Product:

For Project Tacitus, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should include essential features and functionalities that demonstrate the core value proposition of the platform while providing a foundation for iterative development and user feedback. The MVP will be informed by the internal Proof of Concept (PoC) which may change the following outline.
## Legislative Data Aggregation:
Retrieve and aggregate legislative data from reliable sources such as government APIs, focusing on key information such as bills, voting records, representative profiles, and campaign finance data.
Implement data synchronization mechanisms to keep the information current.
## User Authentication and Profiles:
Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Basic user profiles should capture relevant information such as location and areas of interest.
Allow users to create an account and log in securely.
Implement basic user management functionalities, such as profile creation and password reset.
## Bill Search and Filtering:
Enable users to search for bills based on various criteria such as bill number, keyword, sponsor, and legislative status. Implement basic filtering options to refine search results.
Provide a search functionality that allows users to find bills based on keywords, bill numbers, or titles.
Include basic filtering options, such as filtering by policy area, bill type, or sponsorship.
## Bill Detail View:
Provide detailed information for each bill, including its synopsis, sponsors, co-sponsors, legislative history, voting records, and related documents. Users should be able to access comprehensive bill details in a user-friendly interface.
Display the key details of a bill, including the bill number, title, summary, sponsorship, and introduction date.
Show the bill's current status and progress through the legislative process.
Display the voting records of representatives on each bill, showing how they voted (e.g., "Yes," "No," "Abstain").
Provide a summary of the overall vote count for each bill.
## Bill Tracking:
Allow users to track specific bills of interest and receive notifications on key updates or changes in the bill's status.
## Representative Profiles:
Display profiles for elected representatives at the federal, state, and local levels, including biographical information, contact details, committee memberships, voting records, and campaign finance data.
Create a database of elected representatives with their basic information, such as name, party affiliation, and constituency.
Allow users to view representative profiles and access their voting records on specific bills.
## Basic Analytics and Data Visualization:
Incorporate basic data visualization tools to present legislative data and insights in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. This could include simple charts, graphs, and tables to highlight bill sponshorship trends and voting patterns.
## Feedback Mechanisms:
Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user input, suggestions, and bug reports. This could include in-app feedback forms, surveys, or email communication channels to capture user insights and improve the platform iteratively.
