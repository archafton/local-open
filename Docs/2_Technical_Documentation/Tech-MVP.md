# Technical Overview

Project Tacitus is a comprehensive platform designed to provide users with access to legislative data, voting records, and representative information. The platform aims to promote transparency, accountability, and civic engagement by empowering users to explore, analyze, and track legislative activities and the actions of their elected representatives.
The technical architecture of Project Tacitus follows a modern, scalable, and serverless approach, leveraging various cloud services and technologies. The core components of the system include:
## Data Sources:
Project Tacitus integrates with multiple data sources, including government APIs (e.g., ProPublica Congress API), legislative databases, and third-party platforms, to gather comprehensive legislative data, voting records, and representative information.
The data is collected through API calls, web scraping techniques, and direct database connections, ensuring the platform has access to up-to-date and accurate information.
Data Processing and Storage:
The collected data undergoes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, where it is extracted from the source systems, transformed into a standardized format, and loaded into a centralized data storage.
Amazon S3 is used as a scalable and durable storage solution for raw data files, processed datasets, and static assets.
PostgreSQL, a robust relational database, is employed to store structured data, such as legislative records, representative profiles, and user information. The database is designed with a normalized schema to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
Elasticsearch, a distributed search and analytics engine, is utilized to enable fast and flexible full-text search capabilities across the legislative dataset.
## Backend Services:
The backend of Project Tacitus is built using serverless computing, specifically AWS Lambda functions, which allow for scalable and cost-effective execution of code without the need to manage infrastructure.
Lambda functions are responsible for various tasks, including data processing, API handling, and integration with external services.
AWS API Gateway is used to create, publish, and manage APIs that expose the backend functionality to the frontend and other consumers. It acts as the entry point for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate Lambda functions.
To improve performance and reduce the load on the backend services, a caching layer is implemented using Redis. Frequently accessed data is stored in Redis, allowing for faster retrieval and reducing the need for repeated database queries.
## Frontend and User Interface:
The frontend of Project Tacitus is developed using modern web technologies, ReactJS for the web application and React Native for mobile apps (iOS and Android).
The frontend communicates with the backend APIs through HTTP requests, retrieving data and sending user interactions.
The user interface is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing, providing users with a seamless experience for exploring legislative data, tracking representatives, and accessing analytical tools.
Data visualization libraries, such as D3.js or Chart.js, are employed to present complex legislative information in an easily understandable and interactive manner.
## Security and Authentication:
Project Tacitus implements robust security measures to protect user data and ensure secure access to the platform.
User authentication is handled using industry-standard protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens), allowing users to securely log in and access their personalized profiles and preferences.
Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to manage user permissions and restrict access to sensitive data or administrative functions based on user roles and privileges.
Secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, are used to encrypt data in transit, protecting it from unauthorized interception.
## Deployment and Scalability:
The entire infrastructure of Project Tacitus is provisioned and managed using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools, such as Terraform, enabling version control, reproducibility, and automated deployment.
The serverless architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand, ensuring the platform can handle variable workloads and accommodate growth without manual intervention.
Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, enabling rapid iteration and reducing the risk of human errors.
Monitoring and logging solutions, such as Amazon CloudWatch and Elasticsearch, are employed to track system performance, identify potential issues, and facilitate troubleshooting.

By leveraging this technical architecture, Project Tacitus aims to provide a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly platform for accessing and analyzing legislative data. The combination of serverless computing, efficient data storage, powerful search capabilities, and intuitive user interfaces enables users to gain valuable insights into the legislative process and the actions of their elected representatives.

The modular and extensible nature of the architecture allows for future enhancements and integrations, such as incorporating additional data sources, implementing advanced analytics, or expanding the platform's features based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Overall, Project Tacitus represents a cutting-edge solution that harnesses the power of cloud computing, data management, and modern web technologies to promote transparency, accountability, and civic engagement in the legislative domain.
