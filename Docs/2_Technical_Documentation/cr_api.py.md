### Filepath/filename: backend/src/api.py
#### Issues:
1. The database connection string is hardcoded; consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
2. There is no error handling for database operations; wrap database calls in try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions.
3. The code is well-structured, with a clear separation of the API route and database logic.
4. The code does not currently use type hinting; adding type hints for function parameters and return types would improve clarity.
5. The code lacks docstrings for functions; adding docstrings would provide clarity on the purpose and functionality of each function.
6. The application is set to run in debug mode; ensure this is disabled in production environments.
