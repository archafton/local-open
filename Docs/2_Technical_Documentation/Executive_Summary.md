# Project Tacitus: Executive Technical Summary

## Abstract
Project Tacitus is a full-stack legislative data platform that automates the collection, processing, and analysis of congressional data. The system employs a modular architecture to fetch, enrich, and serve legislative information through a modern web interface, with planned AI integration for enhanced data analysis.

## System Architecture Overview

### Data Flow Pipeline

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**
   - Congress.gov API integration fetches raw legislative data
   - Parallel processing streams for bills and member data
   - Automated scheduling for regular data updates
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms for API failures

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Bill enrichment pipeline processes raw data
   - Member data normalization and relationship mapping
   - Structured storage in PostgreSQL with optimized schema
   - Versioning system for tracking legislative changes

3. **API Service Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints serve processed data
   - Real-time filtering and search capabilities
   - Caching mechanisms for performance optimization
   - CORS-enabled for frontend integration

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - React-based frontend with responsive design
   - Real-time data filtering and visualization
   - Theme-aware component system
   - Modular component architecture

### Order of Operations

1. **Data Collection Cycle**
   ```
   Congress.gov API → Raw Data Storage → Enrichment Processing → Database Storage
   ```

2. **Data Enrichment Flow**
   ```
   Raw Bill Data → Text Processing → Relationship Mapping → Analytics Generation → Enriched Storage
   ```

3. **Data Serving Pipeline**
   ```
   Client Request → API Layer → Database Query → Response Processing → Client Delivery
   ```
