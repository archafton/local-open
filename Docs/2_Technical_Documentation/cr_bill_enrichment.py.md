#### Issues:
1. Logging setup is good, but the log file is hardcoded. Consider making it configurable via environment variables.
2. Error handling in `main` could be improved by ensuring the cursor is closed in the `finally` block.
3. The `save_json_response` function lacks error handling for file writing.
4. Database connection may not close properly if an error occurs before connection is made.
5. Consider breaking down the `main` function into smaller functions for better readability.
6. Ensure that the data structure for related bills, text versions, actions, cosponsors, and subjects is consistent with expected input.
