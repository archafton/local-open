#### Issues:
1. Error handling is minimal; consider adding logging for unsupported processor types.
2. Ensure that the environment variable `AI_PROCESSOR_ENDPOINT` is documented for users.
3. The factory pattern is appropriately used to create instances of processors.
4. Type hinting is good but could be more flexible for future processor types.
5. The docstring could be expanded to include information about potential exceptions.
